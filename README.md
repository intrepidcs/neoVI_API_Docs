# The IntrepidCS API - Create your own software applications

**Overview**

The neoVI API provides a simple way to access the neoVI hardware with WIN32 development tools. This documentation describes how to use the API for custom applications. Each API has an example targeted for both C/C++, C#, and Visual Basic (VB). Operational examples are included for [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) Visual C++, [National Instruments](http://www.ni.com) LabVIEW, [National Instruments](http://www.ni.com) LabWindows CVI, [Borland](http://www.borland.com) C++ Builder, [Borland](http://www.borland.com) Delphi, and [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com) Visual Basic.

Included with neoVI is the "icsneo40.dll" DLL. This DLL is a high performance multi-threaded DLL, capable of supporting many neoVI devices simultaneously. The DLL is through dynamic linkage.

For applications using neoVI and ValueCAN devices which do not use Windows, a [Linux interface](http://intrepidcs.com/support/ICSDocumentation/neoAPILinux/LinuxFrameMain.htm) is available. Intrepid Control Systems also has a [Github page](https://github.com/intrepidcs/) with APIs and projects for a verity of different system configurations. Code here can be built to fit the needed system.

**Getting Started**

To get started, review the [Basic Operation](basic-operation-intrepidcs-api/) topic and the topics describing how to use the API in [Visual Basic .NET](basic-operation-intrepidcs-api/using-the-intrepidcs-api-in-visual-basic-intrepidcs-api.md), [Visual C++](basic-operation-intrepidcs-api/using-the-intrepidcs-api-in-visual-c++-intrepidcs-api.md), [Visual C#](basic-operation-intrepidcs-api/using-the-intrepidcs-api-in-c-intrepidcs-api.md), [LabWindows CVI](basic-operation-intrepidcs-api/using-the-intrepidcs-api-in-labwindows-cvi-intrepidcs-api.md), [LabVIEW](basic-operation-intrepidcs-api/using-the-api-in-labview-intrepidcs-api.md), [Borland C++ Builder](basic-operation-intrepidcs-api/using-the-intrepidcs-api-in-borland-c++-builder-intrepidcs-api.md), [Unity Engine](basic-operation-intrepidcs-api/unity3d-graphic-display-api.md), and [Borland Delphi](basic-operation-intrepidcs-api/using-the-intrepidcs-api-in-delphi-intrepidcs-api.md).
